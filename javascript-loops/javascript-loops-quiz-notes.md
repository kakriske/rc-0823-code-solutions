## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops are used for running the same code over and over, each time with a new value.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The condition is tested each time the loop runs. When it is true it keeps running. When it is false it stops.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  The number of times the code block reads.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition is evaluated before the start of the code.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization is evaluated at the beginning of the loop.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a for loop is evaluated each time the loop runs. If true it keeps going.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  When the condition expression is false.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  (!value) break

  increments by 1.

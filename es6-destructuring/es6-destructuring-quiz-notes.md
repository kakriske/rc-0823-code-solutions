## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  It seems like a way to grab a lot of information in a quick manner.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {property1 , ..., propertyN} = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [property1, ..., properyN] = Array;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  You can tell destructuring because the curly bracket/brace will be on the left and with creating will be on the right.
